# ABC-Analysis

Overview:

ABC analysis (Pareto analysis) categorizes items into three classes based on their importance:

Class A: Top 20% of items contributing to ~80% of total value
Class B: Next 30% of items contributing to ~15% of total value
Class C: Remaining 50% of items contributing to ~5% of total value

The analysis helps identify high-value products (A) that should receive priority in inventory management, purchasing, and sales strategies
